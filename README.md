# **FitSync**

FitSync is a MERN stack application that helps users achieve their fitness goals through a simple and intuitive interface. Users can log in via Firebase authentication, manage their fitness profiles, track nutrition and activities, and receive personalized advice from an AI-powered GPT chatbot. The app calculates users' Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and tracks calories consumed and burned to assist with diet and exercise management. A progressive overload feature allows users to monitor their strength progress by recording weights and repetitions. The frontend is built with React.js and MaterialUI, while the backend uses Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, with API routes tested for reliability. Upcoming features include a weight gain/loss calculator, enhanced AI recommendations, and automation for logging nutrition and fitness data.
