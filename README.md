FitSync is a MERN stack application that helps users achieve their fitness goals by providing a simple and intuitive interface. Users can log in via Firebase authentication and manage their fitness profiles, track their nutrition and activities, and receive personalized advice through an AI-powered GPT chatbot. The app calculates users' Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and tracks calories consumed and burned, helping users manage their diet and exercise. A progressive overload feature allows users to track their strength progress with exercises by recording weights and repetitions. The frontend is built with React.js and MaterialUI, while the backend uses Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, with API routes tested for reliability. In progress features include a weight gain/loss calculator, enhanced AI recommendations, and automation for logging nutrition and fitness data.
